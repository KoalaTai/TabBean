# Secure Tab Manager: Immediate Next Steps

## 1. Performance Optimizations

### 1.1 Implement lazy loading for the tab list
- [ ] Research best practices for lazy loading in React
- [ ] Modify the TabList component to support lazy loading
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large numbers of tabs
- [ ] Test and measure performance improvements

### 1.2 Optimize database queries
- [ ] Profile current database queries to identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Implement database indexing for frequently queried fields
- [ ] Optimize MongoDB aggregation pipelines
- [ ] Consider implementing database caching (e.g., with Redis)

### 1.3 Implement caching
- [ ] Identify data suitable for caching (e.g., user preferences, frequently accessed tabs)
- [ ] Implement client-side caching in the extension
- [ ] Set up server-side caching for API responses
- [ ] Ensure cache invalidation is properly handled

## 2. User Experience Enhancements

### 2.1 Add drag-and-drop functionality for tab reordering
- [ ] Research drag-and-drop libraries compatible with React
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop in the TabList component
- [ ] Ensure drag-and-drop actions are reflected in the backend
- [ ] Add animations for smooth user experience

### 2.2 Implement customizable themes
- [ ] Design a set of default themes (e.g., light, dark, high contrast)
- [ ] Create a theme selection interface in the extension options
- [ ] Implement a theming system (consider using CSS variables)
- [ ] Allow users to create and save custom themes

### 2.3 Create a dashboard for tab usage statistics
- [ ] Define key metrics for tab usage (e.g., most visited sites, time spent per tab)
- [ ] Implement data collection for these metrics
- [ ] Design and implement a dashboard UI
- [ ] Create data visualization components (consider using a library like Chart.js)

## 3. Security Enhancements

### 3.1 Implement two-factor authentication
- [ ] Research 2FA libraries and best practices
- [ ] Integrate a 2FA solution (e.g., Auth0 Guardian)
- [ ] Modify the login flow to accommodate 2FA
- [ ] Provide user documentation for setting up and using 2FA

### 3.2 Add biometric authentication option
- [ ] Research browser support for biometric authentication
- [ ] Implement biometric authentication for supported platforms
- [ ] Create a fallback mechanism for unsupported devices
- [ ] Test thoroughly across different devices and browsers

### 3.3 Conduct third-party security audit
- [ ] Research and select a reputable security auditing firm
- [ ] Prepare systems and documentation for the audit
- [ ] Conduct the security audit
- [ ] Review findings and create an action plan for addressing any issues

## 4. Testing and Quality Assurance

- [ ] Update and expand unit tests for new features
- [ ] Create integration tests for new functionality
- [ ] Conduct thorough cross-browser testing
- [ ] Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) with a select group of users

## 5. Documentation and User Communication

- [ ] Update user documentation to reflect new features and improvements
- [ ] Create tutorial content (e.g., videos, blog posts) for new functionality
- [ ] Plan a communication strategy to inform users about upcoming improvements
- [ ] Update API documentation if any changes are made

## 6. Deployment and Monitoring

- [ ] Plan a phased rollout of new features
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for new functionality
- [ ] Prepare rollback plans in case of unforeseen issues
- [ ] Monitor user feedback and usage metrics after deployment
